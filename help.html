                                            A community pet is often referred to as a stray animal, but the word
                                            ‘community’
                                            better describes their. The word "stray" gives one the impression that
                                            these
                                            animals don’t have a home — but they do have a home, which is the
                                            environment
                                            they live in! Some of these community pets have been residents in the
                                            environment for much longer than some of the residents. Hence, they are
                                            a part
                                            of the community too!

                                            make sure that you feed responsibly and that the area is cleaned up

                                            It is advisable to NOT remove a community pet from its environment

                                            consider getting it sterilised if isn’t already and return it to the

                                            We can’t stress enough the importance of keeping pet cats indoors. A

                                                    It is common for the mother to leave her babies for a few hours to
                                                    hunt for food. If you are

                                                    in front of the babies, the mother is not going to appear. The best
                                                    thing you can do is
                                                    to walk off and check back periodically. If the babies are still

                                                    The vet will be able to provide good advice on how and what to feed

                                                    If the mother is around, it is recommended to leave the mother and

                                            animals for sale in their home or on unlicensed premises, send them to AVA

                                            Please also remember that pet abandonment is considered a form of animal
                                            abuse, which is a crime,
                                            because many domesticated animals cannot survive on their own.
                                            These animals do not have the adequate survival instincts to fend for
                                            themselves against the
                                            dangers in their new environment they are prone to diseases, starvation,
                                            injury, and even death.

                                            When you abandon your pets, you are also passing on your problem to a
                                            hapless caregiver who has to
